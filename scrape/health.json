Affinity Health Plan is a not-for-profit managed care plan serving the New York metropolitan area.Affinity filed a breach report with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on April 15, 2010, as required by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH Act. The HITECH Breach Notification Rule requires HIPAA-covered entities to notify HHS of a breach of unsecured protected health information. Affinity indicated that it was informed by a representative of CBS Evening News that, as part of an investigatory report, CBS had purchased a photocopier previously leased by Affinity. CBS informed Affinity that the copier that Affinity had used contained confidential medical information on the hard drive.Affinity estimated that up to 344,579 individuals may have been affected by this breach. OCR's investigation indicated that Affinity impermissibly disclosed the protected health information of these affected individuals when it returned multiple photocopiers to leasing agents without erasing the data contained on the copier hard drives. In addition, the investigation revealed that Affinity failed to incorporate the electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored on photocopier hard drives in its analysis of risks and vulnerabilities as required by the Security Rule, and failed to implement policies and procedures when returning the photocopiers to its leasing agents. This settlement illustrates an important reminder about equipment designed to retain electronic information: Make sure that all personal information is wiped from hardware before it's recycled, thrown away or sent back to a leasing agent, said OCR Director Leon Rodriguez. 'HIPAA covered entities are required to undertake a careful risk analysis to understand the threats and vulnerabilities to individuals' data, and have appropriate safeguards in place to protect this information.'In addition to the $1,215,780 payment, the settlement includes a corrective action plan requiring Affinity to use its best efforts to retrieve all hard drives that were contained on photocopiers previously leased by the plan that remain in the possession of the leasing agent, and to take certain measures to safeguard all ePHI."}, {"state": " Wisconsin ", "country": "United States", "victim": "Tomah Memorial Hospital", "industry": "Healthcare Provider", "records_affected": "600", "year": "2010", "month": "4", "day": "16", "type": "Other", "location": "Other", "description": "A nurse impermissibly used the protected health information (PHI) of approximately 600 patients to obtain narcotics from the covered entity (CE), Tomah Memorial Hospital, for her own use.The PHI involved in the breach included patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 names and account numbers.The CE provided breach notification to HHS, affected individuals, and the media.Following the breach, the CE improved safeguards by creating a monthly audit of Schedule II narcotics, matched to the dispense log, medical order, and bill.

The monetary payments of $4,800,000 include the largest HIPAA settlement to date.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and Columbia University (CU) following their submission of a joint breach report, dated September 27, 2010, regarding the disclosure of the ePHI of 6,800 individuals, including patient status, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results. NYP and CU are separate covered entities that participate in a joint arrangement in which CU faculty members serve as attending physicians at NYP. The entities generally refer to their affiliation as 'New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.' NYP and CU operate a shared data network and a shared network firewall that is administered by employees of both entities. The shared network links to NYP patient information systems containing ePHI.The investigation revealed that the breach was caused when a physician employed by CU who developed applications for both NYP and CU attempted to deactivate a personally-owned computer server on the network containing NYP patient ePHI. Because of a lack of technical safeguards, deactivation of the server resulted in ePHI being accessible on internet search engines. The entities learned of the breach after receiving a complaint by an individual who found the ePHI of the individual's deceased partner, a former patient of NYP, on the internet.In addition to the impermissible disclosure of ePHI on the internet, OCR's investigation found that neither NYP nor CU made efforts prior to the breach to assure that the server was secure and that it contained appropriate software protections. Moreover, OCR determined that neither entity had conducted an accurate and thorough risk analysis that identified all systems that access NYP ePHI. As a result, neither entity had developed an adequate risk management plan that addressed the potential threats and hazards to the security of ePHI. Lastly, NYP failed to implement appropriate policies and procedures for authorizing access to its databases and failed to comply with its own policies on information access management.'When entities participate in joint compliance arrangements, they share the burden of addressing the risks to protected health information,' said Christina Heide, Acting Deputy Director of Health Information Privacy for OCR. 'Our cases against NYP and CU should remind health care organizations of the need to make data security central to how they manage their information systems.'NYP has paid OCR a monetary settlement of $3,300,000 and CU $1,500,000, with both entities agreeing to a substantive corrective action plan, which includes undertaking a risk analysis, developing a risk management plan, revising policies and procedures, training staff, and providing progress reports."}, {"state": " Oklahoma ", "country": "United States", "victim": "University of Oklahoma - Tulsa, Neurology Clinic", "industry": "Healthcare Provider", "records_affected": "19200", "year": "2010", "month": "9", "day": "27", "type": "Hacking/IT Incident", "location": "Desktop Computer", "description": ""}, {"state": " California ", "country": "United States", "victim": "LORENZO BROWN, MD INC.", "industry": "Healthcare Provider", "records_affected": "928", "year": "2010", "month": "9", "day": "29", "type": "Theft", "location": "Desktop Computer", "description": ""}, {"state": " Texas ", "country": "United States", "victim": "Debra C.
