officials said they believed last week's theft of identity data on 3.3 million people with student loans was the largest-ever breach of such information and could affect as many as 5% of all federal student-loan borrowers.  names, addresses, social security numbers and other personal data on borrowers were stolen from the st. paul, minn., headquarters of educational credit management corp., a nonprofit guarantor of federal student loans, during the weekend of march 20-21, according to the company.  ecmc said the stolen information was on a portable media device. \"it was simple, old-fashioned theft,\" said ecmc spokesman paul kelash. \"it was not a hacker incident.\"  citing state and federal criminal investigations, ecmc has released only limited information about the theft since posting a notice on its web site friday. it plans to notify affected customers in writing this week.  david hawn, ecmc's chief business-development officer, said the company didn't believe the data theft was connected with last week's enactment of the largest overhaul of federal student-loan rules in decades. details are being worked out on how the new law will be implemented, and ecmc said it was still evaluating how the legislation would affect it.  the ecmc incident is the latest in a series of thefts of consumers' financial data in recent years. earlier this month, a former employee of hsbc holdings plc allegedly stole data on about 24,000 swiss private-bank accounts. in 2005, 40 million accounts serviced by payment processor cardsystems were compromised. in 2007, tjx co., the company that owns retailer t.j. maxx, disclosed that 45 million credit- and debit-card account numbers had been breached.  all told, more than 347 million records containing sensitive information have been compromised in the u.s. since 2005, according to the privacy rights clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer group.  the student-loan market has battled data losses before. in 2006, 1.7 million computer records held by texas guaranteed student loan corp. were breached, while the u.s. department of education said a bug in its web site compromised data on 21,000 people.  ecmc's st. paul headquarters has card-key access for the 320 employees who work there, mr. hawn said. he said the company was reviewing its security.  ecmc services and insures more than $11 billion in student loans for the u.s. department of education. ecmc also owns premiere credit llc, a federal student-loan collection agency. no premiere accounts were affected by the theft, mr. hawn said.  federal student-loan guarantors such as ecmc, usa funds and american student assistance have contracts with the federal government to insure student loans against default. some guarantors also originate student loans, although ecmc does not.  ecmc is the designated guarantor for loans in oregon, virginia and connecticut, but borrowers from all states could be affected.  the 3.3 million social security numbers that were stolen from ecmc represent 8.9 million loans, mr. kelash said. one borrower may take out multiple loans.  \"we are working with ecmc to make sure that affected individuals are provided with resources to protect their information and to provide with them with identity-theft insurance,\" said u.s. department of education spokesman justin hamilton.  write to mary pilon at

jpmorgan chase & co is warning some 465,000 holders of prepaid cash cards issued by the bank that their personal information may have been accessed by hackers who attacked its network in july.  the cards were issued for corporations to pay employees and for government agencies to issue tax refunds, unemployment compensation and other benefits.  jpmorgan said on wednesday it had detected that the web servers used by its site www.ucard.chase.com had been breached in the middle of september. it then fixed the issue and reported it to law enforcement.  bank spokesman michael fusco said that since the breach was discovered, the bank has been trying to find out exactly which accounts were involved and what information may have been compromised. he declined to discuss how the attackers breached the bank's network.  fusco said the bank was notifying the cardholders, who account for about 2 percent of its roughly 25 million ucard users, about the breach because it couldn't rule out the possibility that their personal information was among the data removed from its servers.  the bank typically keeps the personal information of its customers encrypted, or scrambled, as a security precaution. however, during the course of the breach, personal data belonging to those customers had temporarily appeared in plain text in files the computers use to log activity.  the bank believes \"a small amount\" of data was taken, but not critical personal information such as social security numbers, birth dates and email addresses.  cyber criminals covet such data because it can be used to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards and engage in identity theft. many states require banks to notify customers if they believe there is any chance that such information may have been taken in a breach.  the bank is also offering the cardholders a year of free credit-monitoring services.  the warning only affects the bank's ucard users, not holders of debit cards, credit cards or prepaid liquid cards.  fusco said the bank had not found that any funds were stolen as a result of the breach and that it had no evidence that other crimes have been committed. as a result, it was not issuing replacement cards.  the spokesman declined to identify the government agencies and businesses whose customers it had warned about the breach.  officials from the states of louisiana and connecticut said the bank notified them this week that personal information of some of their citizens may have been exposed.  louisiana citizens included about 6,000 people who received cards with state income tax refunds, plus 5,300 receiving child support payments and 2,200 receiving unemployment benefits, according to a statement from state commissioner of administration kristy nichols on wednesday.  nichols said louisiana would \"hold jp morgan chase responsible\" for protecting the rights and personal privacy of the citizens.  connecticut treasurer denise nappier said she was \"dismayed\" that the bank took two and a half months to notify the state of the problem.  \"jpmorgan chase has some work to do, not only to assure the holders of its debit cards, but also to restore the state's confidence in the company's ability to remain worthy of our continued business,\" nappier said in a statement on thursday.  the bank said it didn't know who was behind the attack, though the secret service and fbi were investigating the matter.  businesses and government agencies are increasingly using prepaid cards because they are easier to cash than paper checks.  yet the vast stores of data behind payment cards of all kinds have created new risks. in 2007, some 41 million credit and debit card numbers from major retailers, including the owner of t.j. maxx stores, were stolen.  in may of this year, u.s. prosecutors said a global cybercrime ring had stolen $45 million from banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from automated teller machines in 27 countries.

focused on the timely delivery of packages, but also helped philomath police nab a bad guy.  the ups driver, who regularly serves the philomath route but asked that he not be identified, offered a tip to police on nov. 17 that he suspected identity theft at a college street address.  \"the reason he suspected is because that particular unit and the one next to it were empty,\" philomath police sgt. ken rueben said. \"but every day, he was delivering boxes to these locations with different names. so, he said, 'i know the people that lived there before and the people that lived there before them and these people's names are not the people on the packages.'\"  ups supplied a list of names of deliveries to the address and although the contents of the packages were unknown, they originated from retail stores such as office depot and sears.  the driver then returned to police with more useful information.  \"he came in another day and said, 'i think the guy living in 1407 (college st.) is the guy that's ordering this stuff,'\" rueben said. \"because he saw the guy come out and he was looking around, and then a lady came out who ends up being the suspect's mom. she came out and said, 'it's my son, he's a criminal' and basically said 'hey, he's done this before.' ... so he reports this to us.\"  police researched the man's name, richard anthony upshaw, and discovered he was the suspect in similar activities in the fresno, california, area.  a bit of confusion surrounded the whole situation because upshaw, 42, was actually investigated in july by the benton county sheriff's office.  a case report shows upshaw was renting a space and living in a recreational vehicle on the philomath frolic rodeo grounds. the first contact with upshaw involved a domestic dispute call, which resulted in his arrest for violating a restraining order.  an investigation soon followed and included interviews, property seizure and involvement of the u.s. secret service in california. seized evidence pointed to identity theft and counterfeiting. the end result turned out to be 18 months of probation for upshaw after a no contest plea to four felony charges.  fast forward to the philomath pd's investigation, which determined that upshaw was living in an rv parked behind four housing units at the 1407 college st. address. the man's connection to philomath was his mother, who was living in one of the four apartments.  following interviews and phone calls, police learned that the name of a woman living with upshaw was using the identity of a victim from the robbery of a liberty tax service in fresno. various records were stolen, including income tax forms.  \"these people started getting credit cards opened up in their name, typical identity theft type of thing,\" rueben said. \"what makes this guy interesting though, is he changed all these people's addresses to addresses here.\"  upshaw apparently started applying for credit cards with all types of details about the liberty victims _ names, dates of birth, social security numbers, home addresses and more.  police learned of another investigation in scotts valley, california, that also resulted in upshaw's arrest. that occurred in may and included four felony charges _ forgery, making fictitious checks, identity theft and methamphetamine possession. the scotts valley police department did not prosecute while awaiting word from the secret service about the ongoing federal case.  a california grand jury indicted upshaw on dec. 4 on several counterfeiting charges. philomath pd arrested him on dec. 8 after being contacted by the secret service.  pause current time 0:00 / duration time 0:00 loaded: 0%progress: 0%0:00 fullscreen 00:00 mute he was later transferred to u.s. custody in portland with eventual extradition to california.  \"they told us not to do any more investigation on the state case until they're finished with their federal stuff,\" rueben said.  if convicted, upshaw faces serious time on the federal charges, perhaps 20 or more years. as a result, it's possible the local case against him would not continue, rueben said.  \"we put a call out to our local agencies that are getting $100 bills coming through and we've got five now that we think are him,\" rueben said back on dec. 12. \"we've got stuff to file on him if we need to.\"  filing a state case against upshaw really wouldn't serve a purpose other than documentation, rueben said.  \"i contacted all of the victims __ they're all victims before in the scotts valley and fresno cases, so they've all got their credit cards changed and credit histories blocked, etc.,\" rueben said.  in the end, it was the tip offered by the ups driver that set the stage for upshaw's arrest in philomath on dec. 8  \"these ups guys know what's going on and if they see something suspicious (they take action),\" rueben said. \"this guy could've really ripped off a bunch of people. if he would've gotten established and started ripping off people around here, identity theft can ruin your life.\"", "info_source": ["tecamac"], "source_link": null},

"monetary_loss_isEstimate": null, "description": "The equifax credit bureau confirmed tuesday that criminals have stolen credit reports from annualcreditreport.com, the website designed to allow consumers free access to their own credit reports.  the theft  suggests criminals have outfoxed annualcreditreport.coms defenses, potentially giving them access to potentially 200 million americans credit reports. according to the consumer financial protection bureau, 16 million consumers use annualcreditreport.com annually.  the nation's three largest credit bureaus -- equifax, experian and transunion -- were required by federal legislation passed in 2003 to offer consumers one free credit report every year. the three jointly operate annualcreditreport.com to fulfill that obligation.  entertainment news website tmz first reported monday that highly detailed personal information on international celebrities and political figures  including jay-z, beyonce, attorney general eric holder and hillary clinton  had been published on a website, and that the fbi was investigating. the same website identified in that report published additional data on tuesday, including details about first lady michelle obama and vice president joe biden, leading to a flurry of interest in the source of the data.  later tuesday, equifax confirmed that some of the data associated with those identity thefts had been stolen from annualcreditreport.com.  \"equifax can confirm that fraudulent and unauthorized access to four consumer credit reports has occurred through the annualcreditreport.com channel, a free public service that allows all consumers to get annual access to their credit report,\" the company said in a statement.  \"our initial investigation shows the perpetrators had the (personal information) of the individuals whose files were accessed and were therefore able to pass the required authentication measures in place. we have launched a full investigation into this matter and we are also working closely with law enforcement authorities on this matter.\"  the statement did not identify which credit reports had been accessed through the website or explain why more than four reports had been published on the website.   transunion and experian also confirmed unauthorized persons had managed to access the credit report data.  \"transunions systems were not hacked or compromised in any way,\" the firm said in a statement to cnbc. \"the sophisticated perpetrators of these fraudulent activities had considerable amounts of information about the victims, including social security numbers and other sensitive, personal identifying information that enabled them to successfully impersonate the victims over the internet in order to illegally and fraudulently access their credit reports. transunion is taking steps to assist the individuals affected to help minimize any potential impact. we are conducting our own internal investigation and working closely with law enforcement.\"  experian also said its systems weren't hacked, adding that \"this looks to be an isolated situation.\"  consumers who attempt to obtain their credit reports from annualcreditreport.com must answer a series of authentication questions. many of these are what's known as \"out-of-wallet\" questions -- questions that a criminal who had stolen a wallet couldn't answer -- such as, \"which bank holds your mortgage\" or \"which of these former addresses are valid.\"  that means the criminals who stole the credit reports probably had access to a host of personal information about their targets, allowing them to successfully answer the authentication questions. some of that data can be purchased from other online data brokers, culled from web pages or even determined through guesswork and the process of elimination.  the federal trade commission regulated the creation of annualcreditreport.com and its security procedures.   ftc spokesman jay mayfield said the data theft serves as another reminder to consumers that they should protect their personal information, but said the agency still recommends that consumers visit annualcreditreport.com or call the credit bureaus to get a free copy of their credit report every year. he would not comment specifically about the theft of the celebrity credit reports, or about the security of annualcreditreport.com  consumers who hear that annualcreditreport.com has been compromised might be dissuaded from using the site in the future, and perhaps paying another third-party firm for their credit reports. doing so would not enhance their security, however.  the data available at annualcreditreport.com could be accessed by criminals, even if the consumer never asks for it.  issues with the authentication procedures at credit report websites have been raised in the past. last year, security analyst dan clements of cloudeyez.com gave nbcnews.com a tour of websites that sell stolen credit reports. several of the stolen credit reports viewed at the time indicated they'd been taken from annualcreditreport.com or other third-party websites that charge a fee for access to credit reports.  \"i'm selling super prime credit reports and scores which include all three bureaus and other information,\" bragged one advertisement on a credit reports for-sale site.  most of the websites were hosted in the .su domain, assigned to the former soviet union. the recently celebrity credit reports are also hosted on a .su web site.  in one how-to posted on a hacker bulletin board, a hacker describes one brute-force attack used to gain access to credit report websites. most sites are protected by \"challenge\" questions such as, \"which bank holds the mortgage on your home?\"  but there's a critical flaw, the hacker said:  \"normally all ... of them will ask you the same question,\" the hacker wrote.  because the sites use the multiple choice format, it's easy to use the process of elimination and determine the correct answers, he claims.  the hacker explained that the trick is to open several credit report sites and keep trying random answers until one set works.  the recipe is highly detailed, including helpful tips such as, \"take a shot of screen to remember what answers you gave. after that click the submit button and see what it says.\"  ",

lender, mount olympus mortgage company, stemming from accusations that a former employee of mount olympus mortgage stole client information and loan files and took them with him when he went to work at guaranteed rate.  according to the lawyers representing mount olympus mortgage, which does business as tru mortgage, one of mount olympus mortgage's former licensed loan officers, benjamin anderson, worked with several other former employees to illegally transfer hundreds of private consumer loan files from mount olympus mortgage's computer systems to guaranteed rate.  in total, anderson allegedly stole early 200 active loan files, as well as the confidential information of approximately 900 mount olympus mortgage clients.  when anderson's alleged theft was discovered, mount olympus mortgage reportedly sent cease-and-desist letters to guaranteed rate, letter that mount olympus mortgage says were ignored.  then, mount olympus mortgage allegedly reported the \"illegal\" conduct to the california attorney general and orange county law enforcement investigators, and filed a civil lawsuit in late june 2014 and asserted claims against anderson for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud, and against both guaranteed rate and anderson for violations of california penal code section 502(c), which covers the unlawful theft of computer data, as well as conversion and misappropriation of the confidential loan files.  according to chad hummel of sidley austin, which represented mount olympus mortgage, given the \"substantial evidence\" revealed during the seven-week trial, the orange county jury found the defendants liable on all counts, awarding $25,100,000, including $13,000,000 for punitive damages to mount olympus mortgage.  in a statement, guaranteed rate states that it never encourage anderson, or any other prospective employee, to steal his or her previous employers data and said that it is \"disappointed\" by the jury's decision.  \"the lawsuit involved mount olympus' assertion that ben inappropriately took loan data about his clients from mount olympus when he joined guaranteed rate, and that guaranteed rate encouraged him to do so,\" the company said in a statement.  \"guaranteed rate would never encourage ben anderson, much less any loan officer to bring over loans in process or download their previous company's data for our benefit,\" the company continued.  \"needless to say, we are disappointed in the jury's finding and strongly disagree with the outcome (of the lawsuit),\" the statement continued. \"we are reviewing all available options for an appeal in the case.\"  according to hummel, the jury found that guaranteed rate's \"aggressive recruiting efforts\" of anderson began in early march 2014 and allegedly involved the highest levels of the company, including several members of guaranteed rate's executive team.  hummel said that victor ciardelli, guaranteed rate's ceo, and james elliott, guaranteed rate divisional sales manager, \"spearheaded the negotiations\" that led to an employment agreement that anderson signed on april 18, 2014.  \"the agreement offered anderson an incentive-laden compensation package for the first 60 days, to induce him to join the company and transfer loan files directly from mount olympus mortgage's computer systems to guaranteed rate,\" hummel said.  after signing the employment agreement, hummel said that anderson began \"surreptitiously siphoning\" mount olympus mortgage client data from late april to june 5, 2014, when the misconduct was discovered and anderson's employment with mount olympus mortgage was terminated.  from there, the lawyers got involved, leading to the $25 million decision handed down by the jury.  \"we are extremely gratified by the jury's findings,\" said mount olympus mortgage founder and chairman, claude arnall.  \"i am hopeful that our successful pursuit of this case sends a strong message to companies engaged in unethical recruiting tactics: don't steal computer data from your competitors,\" arnall said.  \"now more than ever, the mortgage industry depends on legitimate and fair practices, and maintaining the integrity of private consumer financial data is a responsibility entrusted to every mortgage bank that we cannot and should not take lightly,\" arnall continued. \"i hope guaranteed rate now understands those basic principles.\"  as for guaranteed rate, it said that it plans to explore its appeal options and its operations will not be impacted by this decision.  \"we want to assure everyone that this verdict will have no impact on our employees, our borrowers or our referral partners in any way,\" guaranteed rate stated.  \"guaranteed rate remains financially strong and this does not change anything regarding our objective in building and growing the business,\" the company continued. \"guaranteed rate will continue to focus on providing the best value proposition to our customers, our employees and our referral partners.\"", "info_source": ["nicholas.braam@my.southcentral.edu"], "source_link":

alleged roles in a scam that stole millions of dollars from rbs worldpay were no fools. the small crew of hackers had a distinct division of labor, operated with skill and efficiency and left one of the worlds larger banks holding the bag.  viktor pleshchuk, sergei tsurikov, oleg covelin and a fourth man, identified only as hacker 3, pooled their talents, and with the help of a worldwide network of cashers in more than 280 cities, they were able to walk away with $9 million of rbs worldpays money. the attack, detailed in a federal indictment announced tuesday by the department of justice, illustrates clearly the level of organization and sophistication involved in atm and payment-card fraud, as well as the difficulty banks face in guarding against these schemes.  the scam began simply and came together quickly. in early november 2008, prosecutors allege that covelin discovered a vulnerability in the network of rbs worldpay, a subsidiary of the royal bank of scotland that handles payroll and other payment-processing transactions for companies around the world. covelin took his find to tsurikov, who in turn brought in pleshchuk, the man who had the technical skills to exploit the vulnerability. tsurikov allegedly acted as a kind of social director throughout the scheme, bringing together various people, matching up a need with a skill set.  on nov. 5, covelin allegedly gave pleshchuk a username and password for a server on the rbs network in georgia. once inside the rbs worldpay network, the hackers, led by pleshchuk, allegedly gained access to a database containing the account numbers and pins of payroll debit cards that the companys customers give to their employees in lieu of live paychecks or direct deposits. the cards allow employees to withdraw funds directly from atms, up to a pre-set limit, or buy merchandise from approved vendors.  the indictment does not spell out the exact structure of the database that the hackers allegedly compromised and makes no mention of encryption of the data set. but, the attackers were able to get both the debit card account numbers and the pins associated with those accounts. its unclear whether the account numbers and pins were stored together. after getting that data, pleschchuk, tsurikov and hacker 3 allegedly went in and jacked up the amount of money available on the debit cards and raised the withdrawal limits on the cards, as well. the trio then sent 44 prepaid payroll card numbers and pins to a pre-arranged network of cashers. typically, someone in these networks takes the numbers and pins and creates a fake card programmed with the data.  then, just three days after the crews first foray into the banks network, on nov. 8, cashers in 280 cities around the world began hitting atm machines, withdrawing predetermined amounts at each one and then moving on to another terminal.  within 12 hours, the crew had stolen more than $9 million from rbs worldpay, a massive one-day loss even for a company the size of rbs.  meanwhile, pleschchuk and tsurikov allegedly went back into rbs worldpays network to monitor the activity while the cashers were making their rounds, ensuring that the mules did their jobs. the hackers were letting the cashers keep a sizable portion of their withdrawalsbetween 30 and 50 percentso they wanted to know exactly how much money would be coming their way.  after the attack was over, pleshchuk and tsurikov allegedly went into the rbs worldpay database logs and began deleting any information that would point to their scheme, according to the indictment. but the crew apparently didnt do a very good job of covering its tracks. security officials at rbs worldpay noticed the fraudulent transactions quickly and reported them to law enforcement. and now, pleschchuk, tsurikov, colevin and hacker 3, along with four alleged co-conspirators, igor grudijev, ronald tsoi, evelin tsoi, mihhail jevgenov, are facing federal charges and several years in prison for their trouble.", "info_source": ["swidup"], "source_link": null},

levied a civil monetary penalty for a violation of the privacy provisions of the health insurance portability and affordability act.  cignet health center, a group of clinics based in prince georges county, md., that operates a health plan, has been fined $4.3 million for failing to turn over medical records to patients who requested them and failing to cooperate with the hhs probe.  the case is a reminder to physicians that patients always have a right to see their medical records and that it's essential to cooperate with investigations by hhs or state agencies, said andrew wachler, a health care attorney in royal oak, mich.  \"to me, if there's a lesson here it is that the respect for patients' entitlement to medical records is significant,\" wachler said, suggesting that health workers may have held back records because they might think patients were looking at records \"to see if something was done wrong.\"  the cignet penalty has caught the attention of health care compliance professionals who closely watch hhs enforcement activities, said roy snell, chief executive officer of the health care compliance assn. based in minneapolis.  \"effective compliance and privacy officers have been focused on this for a long time,\" he said. \"this is just going to draw renewed attention and focus on this particular segment of the regulation.\"  the case originated in september 2008 with complaints from patients of cignet's clinics who wanted to change physicians and asked for copies of their medical records to share with new doctors, according to hhs. the patients told hhs that cignet refused to hand them over, in violation of hipaa law. ultimately, 41 patients complained that they were denied access to their records.  cignet practice administrator dan e. austin, md, did not return phone messages left with staff at the clinic's office.  rachel seeger, spokeswoman for the hhs office of civil rights, which enforces hipaa's privacy rule, said the agency gave the clinic's executives two years to comply with the request to hand over documents and resolve the matter informally.  according to the penalty letter it sent to cignet, the agency received no response to letters, orders, multiple deadlines and hearings. a february 2010 subpoena and scheduled hearing from u.s. district court went unanswered, the penalty notice said.  on april 7, 2010, in response to the investigation, cignet sent 59 boxes of medical records to the u.s. dept. of justice, including not only those of the 41 patients who had requested them, but 4,500 other patients whose records should not have been disclosed, the notice said.  but the clinic never offered a defense about its failure to provide those documents earlier or its failure to cooperate with hhs. it was notified of a final determination of the civil monetary penalty in a feb. 4 letter.  the $4.3 million fine does not include a penalty for those unauthorized disclosures because the office was responding only to the initial patient complaints, seeger said.  cignet's failure to respond to the investigation was unprecedented, seeger said. \"we have had investigations with covered entities in the past where there may have been early-on failure to want to cooperate with the investigation, but as you can see, ocr provided multiple and repeated opportunities to resolve this through informal means.\"  of the $4.3 million penalty, $3 million is for failing to cooperate with the investigation and $1.3 million is for failing to turn over the medical records requested by patients.  the penalties for hipaa privacy rule violations were raised under the 2009 health information technology for economic and clinical health act.  wachler said the higher fines are a good reason to always respond to hhs inquiries and communications.  \"when you ignore a government agency enforcing the law and do not even cooperate to provide them necessary documents, reply to communications or cooperate in any fashion, my experience is that the hammer falls pretty hard,\" he said.  dr. austin's maryland medical license was revoked on may 24, 2000, after he was convicted of mail and loan fraud stemming from a scheme involving student loans granted to fictitious u.s. residents for attendance at schools outside the country, according to maryland board of physicians records. the order revoking dr. austin's license said he was indicted in july 1994 and sentenced to 31 months in prison in 1997.", "info_source": ["swidup"], "source_link": null},

(choicepoint was widely accused of planning to notify only california residents when it learned that information on at least 145,000 americans had fallen into the hands of thieves; the company, however, said it was planning on nationwide notification all along.)  now, with each week bringing new reports of data loss, whether because tapes fell off the back of a u.p.s. truck or because data was electronically stolen by hackers or thieves, at least five other states - arkansas, north dakota, georgia, montana and washington - have passed similar notification laws. as of last month, dozens of other states were considering similar laws.  in the most recent incident, citigroup executives say the box containing the tapes was handed over to u.p.s., along with other items for shipping, on may 2, under \"special security procedures\" that the bank required of the courier. one of those special procedures, said citigroup's chief operations and technology officer, debby hopkins, included scanning the bar code on each package, rather than scanning only the single bar code on the shipment manifest, which is a summary document listing all the packages being moved in one shipment.  according to ms. hopkins, just the summary document was scanned for the box, which was picked up in weehawken, n.j., so u.p.s. was unable to track where in the delivery chain the box was lost. it was not until may 20 that an employee of experian, the credit reporting agency that was to receive the tapes, called citifinancial to report that they had not arrived at experian's data-processing center in allen, tex. an investigation by u.p.s. failed to locate the package.  citifinancial has notified the secret service, which is called whenever there is a compromise of financial data. the agency is investigating the incident, and citifinancial has begun sending letters to all 3.9 million customers advising them of the loss and offering them 90 days of free enrollment in a credit-monitoring service. other institutions with data-loss problems have also offered free credit-monitoring services, some for as long as a year.  a spokesman for u.p.s., norman black, would not go into specifics on where or how the security system broke down, but said the courier was continuing its investigation. mr. black said blame ultimately lay with his company.  \"they tendered us a package and expected it to be delivered in the reliable way that we always do,\" he said, \"and we had to go back to them and tell them that we can't find it.\"  mr. black said that an exhaustive search of all u.p.s. facilities nationwide had turned up no sign of the package. \"it's rare that it gets to the point where we can find no trace of it,\" he said.  a spokesman for experian, donald a. girard, said he had never seen an instance of a shipment of this kind simply disappearing, although he added that he and other credit agencies had been encouraging financial institutions to convert from tapes to encrypted electronic delivery of data.  \"experian has been actively working for quite a while with all major data contributors to convert to electronic data transference,\" mr. girard said, \"to mitigate risk in this process.\"  ms. hopkins of citigroup said that most of the company's divisions already did this, and that the citifinancial unit is scheduled to convert to such electronic transfers in july.  she also said that the missing tapes, which were not encrypted, were created using mainframe-type computers and highly specialized hardware and software that would make it difficult - though not impossible - to extract data from them.  and ms. givens of the privacy rights clearinghouse said, \"your everyday dumpster diver may not know what to do with these tapes, but if these tapes ever find their way into the hands of an international crime ring, i think they'll figure it out.\" ", "info_source": ["swidup"], "source_link": null},

jpmorgan chase, which securities filings revealed was attacked by hackers over the summer. documents: jpmorgans s.e.c. filing updated, 9:03 p.m. | a cyberattack this summer on jpmorgan chase compromised the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses, a tally that dwarfs previous estimates by the bank and puts the intrusion among the largest ever.  the details of the breach  disclosed in a securities filing on thursday  emerge at a time when consumer confidence in the digital operations of corporate america has already been shaken. target, home depot and a number of other retailers have sustained major data breaches. last year, the information of 40 million cardholders and 70 million others were compromised at target, while an attack at home depot in september affected 56 million cards.  but unlike retailers, jpmorgan, as the largest bank in the nation, has financial information in its computer systems that goes beyond customers credit card details and potentially includes more sensitive data.  weve migrated so much of our economy to computer networks because they are faster and more efficient, but there are side effects, said dan kaminsky, a researcher who works as chief scientist at white ops, a security company.  until just a few weeks ago, executives at jpmorgan said they believed that only one million accounts were affected, according to several people with knowledge of the attacks.  as the severity of the intrusion  which began in june but was not discovered until july  became more clear in recent days, bank executives scrambled for the second time in three months to contain the fallout and to reassure skittish customers that no money had been taken and that their financial information remained secure.  the hackers appeared to have obtained a list of the applications and programs that run on jpmorgans computers  a road map of sorts  which they could crosscheck with known vulnerabilities in each program and web application, in search of an entry point back into the banks systems, according to several people with knowledge of the results of the banks forensics investigation, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.  operating overseas, the hackers gained access to the names, addresses, phone numbers and emails of jpmorgan account holders. in its regulatory filing on thursday, jpmorgan said that there was no evidence that account information, including passwords or social security numbers, had been taken. the bank also noted that there was no evidence of fraud involving the use of customer information.  still, until the jpmorgan breach surfaced in july, banks were viewed as relatively safe from online assaults because of their investment in defenses and trained security staff. most previous breaches at banks have involved stealing personal identification numbers for a.t.m. accounts, not burrowing deep into the internal workings of a banks computer systems.  even if no customer financial information was taken, the apparent breadth and depth of the jpmorgan attack shows how vulnerable wall street institutions are to cybercrime. in 2011, hackers broke into the systems of the nasdaq stock market, but did not penetrate the part of the system that handles trades.  jamie dimon, jpmorgans chairman and chief executive, has acknowledged the growing digital threat. in his annual letter to shareholders, mr. dimon said, were making good progress on these and other efforts, but cyberattacks are growing every day in strength and velocity across the globe.  even though the bank has fortified its defenses against the attacks, mr. dimon wrote, the battle is continual and likely never-ending.  on thursday, some lawmakers weighed in. edward j. markey, democrat of massachusetts and a member of the senate commerce committee, said the data breach at jpmorgan chase is yet another example of how americans most sensitive personal information is in danger.  hackers drilled deep into the banks vast computer systems, reaching more than 90 servers, the people with knowledge of the investigation said. as they analyze the contours of the breach, investigators in law enforcement remain puzzled, partly because there is no evidence that the attackers looted any money from customer accounts.  that lack of any apparent profit motive has generated speculation among the law enforcement officials and security experts that the hackers, which some thought to be from russia and may have been sponsored by elements of the russian government, the people with knowledge of the investigation said.  by the time the banks security team discovered the breach in late july, hackers had already obtained the highest level of administrative privilege to dozens of the banks computer servers, according to the people with knowledge of the investigation. it is still unclear how hackers managed to gain such deep access.  the people with knowledge of the investigation said it would take months for the bank to swap out its programs and applications and renegotiate licensing deals with its technology suppliers, possibly giving the hackers time to mine the banks systems for unpatched, or undiscovered, vulnerabilities that would allow them re-entry into jpmorgans systems.  beyond its disclosures, jpmorgan did not comment on what its investigation had found. kristin lemkau, a jpmorgan spokeswoman, said that describing the banks breach as among the largest was comparing apples and oranges.  preparing for the disclosure on thursday, jpmorgan retained the law firm wilmerhale to help with its regulatory filing with the securities and exchange commission, people with knowledge of the matter said. earlier on thursday, some executives  barry sommers, the chief executive of chases consumer bank  flew back to new york from naples, fla., where they had convened for a leadership conference, these people said.  the initial discovery of the hack sent chills down wall street and prompted an investigation by the federal bureau of investigation. the bank was also forced to update its regulators, including the federal reserve, on the extent of the breach.  faced with the rising threat of online crime, jpmorgan has said it plans to spend $250 million on digital security annually, but had been losing many of its security staff to other banks over the last year, with others expected to leave soon.", "info_source": ["eludom"], "source_link":
